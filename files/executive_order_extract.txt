Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq.
) (IEEPA), the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601

I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, in order

ezuelaÕs infrastructure and natural environment through economic mis-
management and confiscatory mining and industrial practices, and catalyze 
a regional migration crisis by neglecting the basic needs of the Venezuelan 
people, hereby order as follows:
